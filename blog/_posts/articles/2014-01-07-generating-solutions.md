We need to create as many diverse solutions as possible. In order to create many diverse solutions we need to involve as many diverse people as possible to help us.

Having a diverse group of capable brains collaborate on a solution will increase our final solution's supperadditivity, a term coined by Scott Page in [a paper][diversity-theorem] where Page proves that diversity trumps ability when solving difficult problems. Supperadditivity enables diverse teams to reach far more successful solutions than individual experts by constantly challenging and building on a solution with new, fresh perspectives. Within capable, diverse teams the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts, the whole is even greater than the most talented individual in the field.
