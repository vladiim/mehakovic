overview: The methods we use to deploy within our digital strategy are a set of tried-and-true concepts, techniques and processes that produce certain positive outcomes. In this article we'll go through why methods matter in our digital strategy, how we can assess methods, the different categorisation of methods and how we collect methods to use at a later point in time.

## Why methods matter

<cite>If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail. <span class="reference">Abraham Harold Maslow </span></cite>

When baking a complicated cake we, well at least most of us, need to follow a recipe. The reason we follow a recipe is that process of baking the cake is, well, complicated. There are many different ingredients with different measures that need to be combined and treated in a set way to produce the expected cake. By following a recipe we can leverage the knowledge of a chef more advanced than ourselves and remove the need to memorise a long list of repeatable instructions. We may make minor alterations of the recipe to suit our individual preferences but we follow the core parts of the recipe as outlined by the author.

Methods for our digital strategy are much like recipes for cooking complicated cakes. They give us a template to follow when trying to solve a particular problem within our organistion's context. The environment in which we deploy our digital strategies aren't as controlled as our kitchen and therefore the outcomes they produce won't be exactly the same as people who have previously used the method. This doesn't discount the fact that we can build on the knowledge of others by using tried and tested methods. Given a method has been used effectively previously we also derisk our strategy greatly.

When creating and managing our digital strategy we are trying to create solutions that solve a problem. Our context allows us to identify the problem and our methods allow us to design a solution. Methods can be broad and multi-faceted, 'build a customer loyalty program to increase customer lifetime value'. Methods can also be simple and specific, 'minimise the fields a user needs to fill in when signing up for your service to decrease the drop off rate'. In both instances the methods give guidance on how to solve a problem.

## Super methods

<cite>Talent hits a target that no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see. <span class='reference'>Arthur Schopenhaur</span></cite>

In order to create and manage digital strategies it is critical to have a diverse pool of methods at your disposal. Your strategies would not be very efficient if your solution to every problem is to 'build a customer loyalty program'. A large diverse pool of methods enables you to deploy the appropriate method for a given problem. 

Equally important to having diverse methods is having a diverse team work on the deployment of the method. Having a diverse group of capable brains collaborate on a solution increases your solution's supperadditivity, a term coined by Scott Page in [a paper][diversity-theorem] where Page proves that diversity trumps ability when solving difficult problems. Supperadditivity enables diverse teams to reach far more successful solutions than individual experts by constantly challenging and building on a solution with new, fresh perspectives. Within capable, diverse teams the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts, the whole is even greater than the most talented individual in the field.

## The anatomy of a method

A method is a systematic way to accomplish something. Methods are made up of resources and processes. Resources are things of value that are required to deploy your method, think ingredients in your cake recipe. Processes are instructions on how you put your resources to work, think instructions in a recipe.

Methods can be documented a number of ways depending on the complexity of the solution they are solving. A method can be a straight-forward and prescriptive such as a [set of practices to adhere to when designing a responsive website][smashing-responsive-design]. Methods can also be complex like a set of guidelines to follow based on case studies on success and failure of MP3 Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the 1990's. In 2004, when LinkedIn were under a million users, company founder Reid Hoffman saw how eBay, PayPal and Google had disrupted markets by using the power of networks. This is a high-level method but allowed Hoffman to create a strategy for applying the same [network method to careers][linkedin-seriesb], by doing so he could broadly map out LinkedIn's future and the positive outcomes he would need to achieve to be successful.

Although methods are based on the thinking of others, they enable us to start ahead and drive innovation faster.

## Method fit

<cite>
  Strategy is creating fit among a company's activities. The success of a strategy depends on doing many things well - not just a few - and integrating among them.
  <span class='reference'>Michael Porter</span>
</cite>

The mix of methods that any one organisation uses and deploys will never be the same as another organisations. Even if they were, the companies wouldn't be deploying the methods in exactly the same way. In his excellent paper [What is Strategy?][what-is-strategy], Michael Porter describes the purposeful interlinking of a company's activities 'fit'. It's important that our methods also have fit, wherein we consider how our different methods interplay with each other. When creating fit amongst the methods in our digital strategy, our aim is to create cumulative value, we want the whole to equal more than the sum of its parts.

When we have a good fit in a digital strategy our systems and channels talk to each other and we are better able to understand and drive value through our context. We can clearly see when a customer signed up to our email, their interaction with us over a period of time and channels, how they purchased a product and ultimately how they became a brand advocate. Given the increasingly fragmented media landscape we find ourselves in, fit between our methods is more important now than ever before.

## Proof in case studies

Regardless of the complexity of the method case studies are an important aspect to understanding any method. Case studies enable us to understand how a method was applied under a certain circumstance. Evaluating the difference in our circumstance and the one outlined in a case study enables us to understand how we would like to vary the application of the method to suite our organisation's unique context. When [proving that networks would drive innovation in career listings][linkedin-seriesb], LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman used case studies of networks driving equivalent innovation in other markets.

## Collecting methods

Up until the mid-2000's, the most coveted room in an ad agency was the art room. The art room was the source of an agency's creative inspiration, the engine of their intellectual property. From minimalist paintings to early 20's magazines to obscure long-lost director reels; the art room provided a menagerie of starting blocks for agency creatives to come up with ideas. As part of the ideation process, the creatives allowed in the room would find an interesting creative approach and mash it up with an idea they already had.

Similarly to the ad industry, design and innovation firm IDEO uses [method cards][method-cards] to help kick start the ideation process. Leveraging other people's ideas and methods to help you evolve your solution a smart commercial practice. No matter what creative problem you're trying to solve, chances are that someone else has tried to solve a similar problem. You may as well start your journey where they left off.

Of course, the internet eventually killed the art room. The collection that took a dedicated art buyer years to collect and organise can be hunted down in minutes with the aid of a search engine. The lesson to take from ad agencies in years gone past is that we need to cultivate inspirational methods that we can go back to and redeploy. We need to collect methods good and bad to use in the future for problems we haven't even seen yet.

In future articles we will begin to build a library of methods, the resources they require, the processes to deploy them, the unique problems they solve and case studies giving an overview of their successful application.

## Types of methods

We apply methods to our organisation in order to create a positive outcome. An analogous process is that of innovation, where something established is changed to creative more positive outcomes by introducing new ideas, resources or processes.

When categorising innovation, Clayton Christensen talks about [disruptive and sustaining innovations][disruptive-innovation]; where a disruptive innovation is one that redefines markets and a sustaining innovation is one that adds incremental efficiencies (usually through technology) to existing markets. The horse saddle was a sustaining innovation that let you utalise horses more efficiently, the car was a disruptive innovation that redefined the personal transportation market.

Scott Page has a similar take to Christensen and discusses [the big coefficient vs a new reality][big-coeff-new-reality]. When optimising for the big coefficient you look to identify an independent variable that has the largest causal relationship (coefficient) with outcome you're trying to achieve e.g. the more relevant the search results (relevancy of results = big coefficient) the more likely a user will continue using my search engine (expected outcome).

The issue with big coefficient thinking is that your ability to think out of the box is heavily diminished meaning so too is your ability to disrupt. In order to disrupt you need to fundamentally change people's behaviour. Therein lies the second portion of Page's framing - the new reality. Within the new reality you give everyone free Healthcare rather than putting a bigger tax on smoking, within the new reality you drive cars rather than ride horses. The aptly named new reality allows us to change the world around us.

So when categorising methods for our organisation we can think of methods that sustain by driving a coeffcient and ones that disrupt by creating a new reality. By viewing the methods we deploy in two distinct categories we can better allocate our time and expectations.

## Using methods

-- image: 3 horizons + sustain/disrupt

It's important that we have different approaches and expectations for sustaining and disruptive innovations. In order to do so we can adapt [McKinsey's 3 horisons of growth][3-horizons] to further categorise how we allocate our resources to the deployment of our methods.

### Horison 1: refine

Methods deployed in the refinement horison look to innovate by improving how our current operations deliver KPIs. For example we may look to ad a new keyword group to our adwords campaign to increase acquisition, or we may look to AB test our product pages to drive increased sales conversions. 

Optimisation methods are the easiest to deploy, are less resource intensive and are reliable at delivering incremental improvements to our organisation's positive outcomes. As a general rule we should invest 70% of our resources into horison 1 given it contains the least risk and continuous incremental sustaining innovations over time have a large cumulative effect.

### Horison 2: scale

Methods deployed in the scale horison look to drive sustaining innovation by taking successful programs from horison 1 and redeploying them elsewhere. An example of this is eBay's first mobile app. Ecommerce mobile apps are a dime a dozen today but eBay's iPhone app was the first of its kind and drove [$4Bn in gross merchandise volume][ebay] for eBay in its first year. eBay achieved great success in creating new revenue by taking its successful marketplace and scaling it to mobile.

Scale can also happen on a product level through observations of user behaviour. Some of Twitter's most famous features such as the hashtag, @ reply and retweet [started off as user habits][twitter-features] and ended up as integral product features.

Horison 2 methods rely on your ability to take something that's working for your organisation and reapplying it successfully elsewhere. Therefore scaling methods are harder to deploy than refining methods as they involve more unknowns and take more resources to launch. At the same time horison 2 methods offer greater returns if successful. As a general rule we should invest 20% of our resources into horison 2 methods.

### Horison 3: disrupt

Methods in horison 3 look to drive disruptive innovations by leveraging a tension point to unlock untapped value. Horison 3 methods are extremely risky and will rarely garner traction however, when they do, the returns are extremely large. For this reason it's important to be able to test many disruption concepts with the view that many small failures will lead to a couple of large successes.

Though Google has created some spectacular products such as Google Images, GMail, Google News and Google Apps, the company has had some phenomenal failures such as the highly anticipate Google Wave or Google Buzz. The distinguishing feature of Google's failed product is the speed at which they kill them off. No slow agonising death, if a product isn't getting the traction Google expects they kill it. 

Google's fail fast technique is in line with how we should be testing our disruption concepts. We need to structure our horison 3 methods so we can test a concept's traction with as little initial investment as possible. We only reinvest if we identify traction.

Before Groupon became the sorld's fastest growing company, it was a collective action platform called The Point. The team came up with the idea for group coupons one night and tested it by putting up an ad for their local pizza shop. The initial pizza ad was so successful that they started a Wordpress site with regular offers, which in turn became a billion dollar company within a year. The Point was able to identify that their new idea had traction because they were trying to generate similar activity for collective action and had seen far less success.

## Assessing methods

For a method to be deployed successfully and deliver sustaining positive outcomes for our organisation we need to ensure it is the right option prior to deployment. Key questions we need to ask are:

* What positive outcomes do we expect to drive from this method?
* How does the method fit into our organisation's context?
* What do we need to do to ensure the method drives value back to our other deployed methods?
* Are we equipped to manage the method optimally on-going? What's the total cost of ownership?

***

## Methods

* Methods are a collection of process that allow us to use a set of resources optimally
* They are helpful as they enable us to leverage and build on the knowledge of people before us
* Identifying and categorising methods enable us to draw from a pool of methods and identify the right on for our purpose
* Methods can be categorised as driving sustaining and disruptive innovation and we need to allocate resources carefully across the categories
* Prior to deploying a method we need to ensure it is fit for our purpose and that it will deliver sustained benefits to our organisation.
