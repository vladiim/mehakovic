## TL;DR

A strategy is the process where we make optimal decisions based on contextual understanding. In order to create a digital strategy we need to identify outcomes, create contextual understanding, frame solutions and optimise through feedback.

## What is a strategy?

<cite>Business is like chess in that the hard part is not knowing the rules about how the pieces move, the hard part is being able to look ahead and make strategies. <span class='reference'>Paul Graham</span></cite>

A strategy is the process where we optimise the decisions we make based on the understanding we have of all our options and their trade-offs. Therefore when we create a strategy we need two things; an understanding of our context, a set of possible decisions. Our strategy then helps us make the right decision.

The difference when we make strategies within a digital environment is that we have access to more information upon which we can make our decisions. This is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because we can more readily gain insights, it is a curse because it is easy to get drowned in a sea of information.

## Why have a strategy?

<cite>The contour of the land is an aid to the army; sizing up opponents to determine victory, assessing dangers and distance. "Those who do battle without knowing these will lose." <span class='reference'>Sun Tzu</span></cite>

Strategies are inherently helpful because they allow us to do more with less. Like many tools strategy was birthed through necessity on the battlefield. It's not surprising war brought on the origins of strategy, as war creates a situation where two sides each have winner-take-all goal, each with a limited amount of resources and many unknowns. The word it self originates from Greek where it meant, the [art of troop leader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy).

Those who deployed strategies in battle won. The ancient Greeks decimated countless opponents by forming a phalanx, a mass formation of heavy infantry. Although they had vastly superior resources, the US army ended their campaign during the Vietnam War due to the Viet Cong's superior knowledge and use of their country's terrain.

In practice modern business has the same constraints as the people who originally deployed strategies in battle. In operating a business we are working toward a goal, we have a limited amount of resources and many unknowns. Much like in battle, being able to understand the context our business is operating in allows us to achieve more with less.

## How we develop a strategy?

In order to develop a strategy we need to go through four phases: identify outcomes, create contextual understanding, frame solutions and optimise through feedback. These four phases will enable us to create a either a **foundation strategy** where we have no current strategy deployed, or an **emergent strategy** where we have a strategy and are looking to improve it.

## 1. Identify outcomes

Outcomes are events that happen as a result of deploying a strategy. They can be positive, like gaining new customers or negative, like loosing market share. In order to guide us in making "the right" decision we need to have a clear understanding on the outcomes we want to create. By identifying and articulating the outcomes we want we can better weigh up our trade-offs and identify the "right" strategy to deploy.

## 2. Create contextual understanding

Contextual understanding allows us to best represent our environment in order to achieve our goals. When creating contextual understanding we need to highlight important insights and disregard informational noise. Our ability to understand our context greatly affects our ability to create the best strategy. Nokia was the most successful mobile phone manufacturer in the world until Apple unveiled that the context for these devices shouldn't be mobile phones but mobile computing. By misinterpreting their context Nokia lost out on one of the most lucrative market in modern business.

## 3. Frame solutions

A solution encompasses the procedures and rules that dictate how we use a set of resources to solve a problem or leverage an opportunity. Solutions take contextual understanding into consideration and define the best course to take. It is impossible to have full contextual understanding, it is also impossible to understand how our environment may change in the future. Therefore any solution we architect as part of our strategy relies on making assumptions.

If we don't make assumptions our ability to make a strategy can be suffocated by analysis paralysis. If assumptions are structured correctly we can overcome them when our solution is in market. For example, we could assume that a simplified checkout process will lead to greater sales, we can test this assumption by testing a simple checkout against our current one.

## 4. Optimise through feedback

<cite>What's measured improves. <span class='reference'>Peter F. Drucker</span></cite>

Feedback allows us to readjust our solutions and contextual understanding based on new insights. How could a general redeploy his troops without knowing how many survived their last battle? In order to gain actionable feedback we need to identify key metrics, measure them correctly and have processes in place that allow for rapid action based on how they change.

## Conclusion

In business as in battle strategies give us a competitive advantage by allowing us to do more with less. Digital strategies allow us to:

* Achieve a positive outcome
* Use our resources to the best of their ability
* Make the right decisions
* Create plans that cope with the unknown.
