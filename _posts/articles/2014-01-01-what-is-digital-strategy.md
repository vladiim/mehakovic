overview: This is the first in a series of weekly articles aimed at teaching anyone on how to create, implement and manage digital strategies. In this introductory article we'll go through the value delivered by strategy, the core components that comprise a robust strategy, why you would want a digital strategy and some of the elements that go into a digital strategy.

## Digital strategy's origins

-> drawing: military

In Greek, strategy means the art of [art of troop leader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy). Though we can use strategies in our day-to-day lives, strategic thinking as a discipline bears its origins from the military where generals looked to achieve and maintain an advantage over their opponent. Itâ€™s not surprising that strategy became a core component of military practice, as in wars you have:

* Two or more sides in combat with each other, each looking to achieve a winner-takes-all goal
* A limited amount of varying resources (troops, weapons, land, food etc)
* Many unknowns (weather conditions, enemy capabilities, terrain etc)

In order to manage all of the factors involved in battle, successful military leaders needed to devise strategies to best use their existing resources and cope with the unknown.

## What is a strategy?

-> drawing: 4 parts to strategy

<cite>Business is like chess in that the hard part is not knowing the rules about how the pieces move, the hard part is being able to look ahead and make strategies. <span class='reference'>Paul Graham</span></cite>

In personal and business life we have a never ending number of decisions we can make at any given point in time. We are constantly faced with trade-offs; should I go to a an expensive restaurant or save the money for a deposit on a new home? Should our business use resources to fix software bugs that will help keep existing users or should we spend resources building a new product feature that will attract new users? A strategy helps us make the decisions we are constantly faced with in a way that leads us to achieving a preplanned outcome.

Using one of the examples above, I may skip the expensive restaurant and save my money for a deposit. The outcome I want to achieve is financially security and my strategy to achieve this outcome is to buy an investment property. This strategy leads me to make a decision where I choose to miss out on a great dinner now to reach my outcome in the long run.

Strategy gives us a set of rules that make it simpler to do the right thing. Broken down further strategy is a set of rules that helps you:

* Achieve an outcome
* Use the assets you have to the best of their ability
* Make the right decisions
* Create plans that cope with the unknown

## What are the components of strategy?

For the use of these articles we'll work with a model of strategy that is made up of four components; outcomes, the context, methods and feedback. We'll briefly go through each of the components of strategy below however we'll continually build on these core components throughout future articles.

### Outcomes

-> drawing: a target

Outcomes are events that happen as a side effect of your strategy being executed. They can be positive, like gaining new customers or negative, like loosing market share. Although you can create positive outcomes without expecting to; having clear outcomes will greatly aid you in creating successful digital strategies. Outcomes give you focus and give you the ability to evaluate whether your strategy is working as they give you an objective measure upon which to evaluate progress.

### The context

Context allows you to represent the world in which you are trying to achieve your goal. When representing context, you seek to highlight that which is important and hide that which is unimportant. Your ability to represent your context will greatly affect your ability to deploy the correct strategy - context allows you to focus on the important tasks at hand. For example, Nokia was the most successful mobile phone manufacturer in the world until Apple unveiled that the context for these devices shouldn't be mobile phones but mobile computing.


### Methods

-> drawing: swiss army knife

Our methods are how we manipulate a solution. A method encompasses the procedures and rules that structure how we deploy resources optimally to achieve an outcome. The outcome of a strategy is the deployment of our resources in the structure outlined by the methods we've chosen. When choosing a methodology we can use one that already exists, look to create our own or do a combination of the two.

Given digital is such a multi-faceted subject area there are a countless number of methods we can draw upon depending on our context. Therefore it is critical that we correctly identify our context in order to deploy the correct methodology. This can be tricky given the complexity of the digital environment. To overcome the reliance between the right methodology and and insightful context many digital practitioners are relying on the principals from the [agile software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) movement and [lean manufacturingg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) both of which focus on the deployment of methods incrementally to help build out context. We'll go through each of these schools of thought in later posts.

### Feedback

-> drawing: frog in boiling water

The ultimate aim of working on a strategy is to successfully achieve a goal. Feedback is critical to this as it allows you to readjust our strategy based on new information. How could a general redeploy his troops unless he knew whether they had won the previous battle? Without this significant contextual information his strategy becomes useless. In order to establish empowering feedback in our strategies we need to identify critical factors, instrument our execution to gather feedback and use processes that allow for rapid, appropriate action based on the feedback received.

## Why is digital strategy important?

--- drawing IOT chart

In a [2011 Wall Street Journal article interview](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html) venerable tech entrepreneur turned venture capitalist, [Marc Andreessen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) claimed that 'software is eating the world'. Every company in the world is becoming or getting disrupted by a technology/software focused company.

Apple [became](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57496464-37/at-$622b-apple-becomes-all-time-most-valuable-company/) the world's most valuable company in 2012 as a hardware manufacturer that enabled software (in Apple's case, apps) to flourish. Six of the [world's top 10 brands in 2013][most-valuable-brands-2013] were technology companies. Software is infiltrating all facets of business; manufacturers of commercial trucks and aviation engines like Caterpillar and Roles Royce now create significant revenue through software that enables fleet managers to track the performance and maintenance needs of their expensive machines. Even Nike, with its Nike + Fuel Band [is now a tech company](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-15/sorry-nike-youre-a-tech-company-now#r=rss).

At the same time that software and the internet is flourishing, more things are becoming connected to software and the internet. Smart sensors embedded into anything and everything will open a new economy of the Internet of Things (IOT). CISCO [recently priced the value potential of the IOT at $14.4 trillion](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoE_Economy.pdf). In other words, the digital economy is big and only going to get bigger.

Digital is an increasingly complex environment. Business models, communications platforms, software, design and development frameworks are constantly being reinvented. Within this chaos you will be bombarded with new options and decisions within a changing landscape and context. By creating, deploying and managing a well structured digital strategy you will be able to ensure the best returns on your efforts.
