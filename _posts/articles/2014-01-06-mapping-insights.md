## Mapping our insights succinctly

<cite>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. <span class="reference">Albert Einstein</span></cite>

Insights are only powerful when they are acted upon. In order to leverage, question, revise and build on our understanding of our organisation’s context, we need to be able to reference our context at all times. We need to be able to carry an illustration of our context to any discussion we have about our digital strategy. This illustration needs to be as simple to grasp as the periodic table, while at the same time encompassing the breadth and depth of the collective understanding we have of our organisational context.

Too often organisations produce well informed insights that are presented once and never again see the light of day. They become trapped in the middle of an overbearing PowerPoint deck that no one has the time to read through. In order to be masters of our organisation’s context we need extract these insights into a simple and visible format.

The tools that achieve this simplicity and depth are:

* The Customer Journey Map (CJM)
* The Business Model Canvas.

We will quickly discuss these tools below and follow up with future in-depth articles. Both tools contain two valuable benefits when mapping context, in that they:

* Help us order our insights in a way that gives us optimal perspective. The better our perspective, [the better our ability is to solve the right problem][diversity-theorem]
* Can be encapsulated on an A4 page. This is important because it allows us to reference and discuss our context with anyone, at any time..

## Tools

personas, service blueprints, storyboards or user journeys, taxonomies, ontologies, customer lifecycle model

### The Customer Journey Map (CJM)

The core positive outcome of any digital strategy involves influencing the behaviour of the people our organisation is trying to serve. Customer Journey Mapping, or Customer Experience Mapping, allows us to evaluate our business context from the point of view of our customer. The person whom we’re trying to serve is the nucleus of our company and by contextualising our organisation from the point of view of our customer, we are able to better identify problems and solutions that will enable us to change our customer’s behavior.

The CJM can be as simple or complicated as you require and easily allows you to reconfigure how you represent your CJM.

### The Business Model Canvas

The [Business Model Canvas][businessmodelgeneration], first published in Alex Osterwalder's groundbreaking book [Business Model Generation][businessmodelgenerationbook] encapsulates the fundamental aspects of any business model. Its genius is in its simplicity.
