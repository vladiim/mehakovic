overview: The content strategy is a framework around governing the type of content your business needs to produce to best engage your audience. Content strategy extends beyond editorial to technical specifications, editorial processes and governance policies. Often it is closely aligned with UX, social or channel strategies also.

## The purpose

Content is the currency of your digital marketing. It is the product information on your site, the images you post on social media feeds and it's the meta data you use to describe yourself to search engines to be found.

During {{page.title}} we answer:

* What types of content do we need to produce?
* How do we bring editorial practices into our business?
* How often will we publish content and to what end?
* Where will we syndicate our content and to what end?
* How will we structure the meta and semantic data coupled with our content?

***

## The work

The work involved in the {{page.title}} includes:

* Initial research (see research services)
* Articulate the strategy:
  - Communications objective based on business requirements
	- The creative platform and over-arching strategy
	- The content categories alongside roles for each category
	- The editorial process for each category
